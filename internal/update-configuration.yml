# By default with GitHub pipelines, secrets associated with
# your build pipeline are not made available to pull request
# builds of forks. These secrets are enabled by default with
# GitHub Enterprise Server pipelines. Secrets include:
#
# - A security token with access to your GitHub repository.
# - These items, if your build uses them:
#   - Service connection credentials
#   - Files from the secure files library (this is what '${{ parameters.secure_file }}' is)
#   - Build variables marked secret
