      # TODO: It seems like we can't use PySide 1/2 with Python 2.7 on Linux.
      #
      # For PySide, we need to install lib-qt4, but then installing PySide
      # requires a compile which is unacceptable. We can't reuse the Python wheels
      # we had on Travis either because they are for a Python with UCS2 and
      # Azure's Python is UCS4.
      #
      # As for using PySide2, pip simply reports that there is no compatible build.
      #
      # Potential solutions are:
      # - Recompile Python
      # - Host a recompiled version of PySide2 compatible with Azure.
